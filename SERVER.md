# New Server

I found some old hardware that has been reconfigured to be an Ubuntu server.

It is slower than the i5 and i7 that I have been using but, it will be a good platform for all the other things I do.

Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2120 CPU @ 3.30GHz with 4 cores.

Since this can be a dedicated server where no development takes place it can be left up longer. Time will tell if it's worth it.

It's easy to tell it is slower by comparing the previous times (from the readme).
